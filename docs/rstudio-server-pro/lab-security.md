## Introduction

Imagine that you are in an organization that standardized authentication using the LDAP protocol and openLDAP.

* In this exercise, we have provided the LDAP server for you.

* Your task is to configure RStudio Server Pro to integrate with the LDAP server.

* When you are finished, users in the LDAP directory should be able to authenticate into RStudio Server Pro.

This exercise is broken into three parts:

1. Explore LDAP and obtain information from the `.ldif` file
1. Use `sssd` to configure your server with LDAP
1. Use PAM to configure RStudio Server Pro


!!! tip
    Remember you will need to use `sudo` commands throughout this exercise.

### Quiz

!!! question "Quiz: Authentication protocols"

    Which authentication protocols are supported by RStudio Server Pro?",
    
    Choose six answers from the following list:
    
    * Operating system
    * Proxy
    * PAM
    * LDAP
    * Google OAuth
    * OAuth 2
    * SAML

??? example "Answer:"

    The correct answer is: Operating system, Proxy, PAM, LDAP, OAuth2 and SAML.
    
    



### How this exercise works

We have set up an LDAP server for you.

* First, configure LDAP
* Second, use PAM to configure RStudio Server Pro 

Successful completion involves:

* LDAP users are accessible from the command line
* LDAP users can login into RStudio Server Pro



### A review of LDAP, sssd and ldif

LDAP is a protocol.

* LDAP is implemented in **many** different ways. For example:
    * Active Directory uses LDAP to communicate
    * OpenLDAP has different standards than Active Directory, for instance
  
`sssd` is a system service

* Makes LDAP a system identity and authentication provider
* This means that all local system accounts are technically already provisioned even if they do not actually exist yet

    * This is `sssd` magic!


LDIF is a file format (with `.ldif` file extension):

* LDAP Data Interchange Format
* A standard plaintext format for representing LDAP objects



### Handy tools

The `ldapsearch` utility:

* A command line utility
* Used to interface with a remote LDAP identity provider
* Query for LDAP entries

The `pamtester` utility:

* A command line utility
* Used to test PAM configuration





## Part 1: Get server information

In this part, you get information you need to configure your server with LDAP. 

### Introduction to ldapsearch


Hint:

* Use `man ldapsearch` to construct your command.

* You can also find the help for `man ldapsearch` at https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch



!!! info
    Important: The LDAP bind password is `admin`. You will need this for the next steps.

Use the `ldapsearch` terminal utility to retrieve an example user from the LDAP credential store. Construct a command with the inputs below. 

The most important things youâ€™ll need to know about your LDAP server are:

* hostname or IP address
* LDAP port number
* base bind DN (disinguished name)


This information allows you to write an `ldapsearch` query in the format:

```sh
ldapsearch -h 1.2.3.4 -p 123 -D dc=example,dc=com [query]
```


In this classroom, the hostname is `leader.example.org`, and the base bind DN is "admin.example.org".

It will also help to know a few of the [LDIF format abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP_Data_Interchange_Format) for search criteria in LDAP:

Code  | Meaning
:---  | :---------------
dn    | distinguished name
dc    | domain component
ou    | organizational unit
cn    | common name


In these codes:

* The **`dn`** refers to the **distinguished name** that uniquely identifies an entry in the directory.
* The **`dc`** refers to each **component of the domain**. For example `www.mydomain.com` would be written as `dc=www,dc=mydomain,dc=com`
* The **`ou`** refers to the **organizational unit** (or sometimes the user group) that the user is part of. A user can be part of more than one group, for example: `ou=Lawyer,ou= Judge`.
* The **`cn`** refers to the individual object, for example person's name, meeting room, job title, etc.


This means that `admin.example.org` can be written as `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org`.

And now you have the essential information for an ldap query:


Argument      | ldapsearch  | Value                         | Note
:------------ | :-----      | :---------------------        | :--------------------------
Bind Password | -w          | admin                         |
Hostname      | -h          | leader.example.org            |
Port          | -p          | 389                           | default value, can be omitted
Bind DN       | -D          | cn=admin, dc=example, dc=org  | DN means "distinguished name"

Note that it is considered unsafe to provide passwords on the commandline. Outside of this training course you should use `-W` to get a password prompt instead.


```sh
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
```

If you issue this LDAP command, you should get:

```
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <> (default) with scope subtree
# filter: (objectclass=*)
# requesting: ALL
#

# search result
search: 2
result: 32 No such object

# numResponses: 1
```


This query doesn't return any useful information, so you want to restrict the starting point of the query, by setting the `searchbase`:

Argument      | ldapsearch  | Value                         | Note
:------------ | :-----      | :---------------------        | :--------------------------
Search Base   | -b          | dc=example, dc=org            | Use searchbase as the starting point for the search instead of the default

```sh
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org
```

Note that this returns **all** elements in the LDAP database!


### Returning a single element

Now that you know how to return the entire database, you can add additional elements to the `[query]`.  

Remember that the generic query format looks like this:

```sh
ldapsearch -h 1.2.3.4 -p 123 -D dc=example,dc=com [query]
```

And you have already tried

```sh
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org
```

By adding a query term at the end, you can search for specific elements.

For example, search for a user named "Joe".  You already know that `cn` indicates the "common name", so try running a query for `cn=joe`:

```sh
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org cn=joe
```

You should get:

```
# joe, engineering.example.org
dn: cn=joe,dc=engineering,dc=example,dc=org
cn: joe
gidNumber: 5000
givenName: Joe
homeDirectory: /home/joe
loginShell: /bin/sh
mail: joe@example.org
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: top
sn: Golly
uid: joe
uidNumber: 10000
userPassword:: e01ENX1qL01raWZrdk0wRm1sTDZQM0MxTUlnPT0=
```


### Inspect the output

Each object in an LDAP directory has at least one **object class** associated with it. The object class determines the characteristics of this object, in particular the set of attributes which the object can have (and the ones it must have).

The object classes are defined in the LDAP directory schema - they constitute a class hierarchy there, there is one central top level class (which is called 'top'), all other classes are derived from that

![image](assets/object-class.png)


Repeat your previous `ldapsearch` command, this time for the user `julie:

```sh
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org cn=julie
```



Here is an extract for the user named `Julie`:

```bash
# julie, engineering.example.org
dn: cn=julie,dc=engineering,dc=example,dc=org
cn: julie
gidNumber: 5000
givenName: Julie
homeDirectory: /home/julie
loginShell: /bin/sh
mail: julie@example.org
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: top
sn: Jolly
uid: julie
uidNumber: 10001
userPassword:: e01ENX1GdkV2WG9ONTRpdnBsZVVGNi93YmhBPT0=
```

Note, in particular, the `objectClass` line:

```bash
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: top
```

This means that users have the attribute: `inetOrgPerson`, `posixAccount` and `top`.


### Task: Get a list of all users

You can use your knowledge that users have the attribute  `inetOrgPerson` in a follow-up `ldapsearch` to get all usernames (`uid`).

Refine your search to return only `inetOrgperson` entries:


```bash
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org objectClass=inetOrgperson
```

And then refine the search once more to return only the `uid` entries:

```sh
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org objectClass=inetOrgperson uid
```

!!! note "Note"
    It is much easier to read and understand the resulting list, making it easier to determine which users are in the system.




### Task: Get a specific user

Now you can get the information you need to configure the server. Query LDAP for information about `julie`. You will use this information in the next step.


```bash
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org cn=julie
```

You can expand your query to include all user and operational attributes

```bash
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org cn=julie \* \+
```


Explanation:

* This returns all information about a single user.
* Searching with `\*` shows all user attributes
* Searching with `\+` shows all operational attributes

In the results:

* `entryUUID` is the _unique identifier_ of a record in openLDAP


### Users and groups

What is the difference between a **user** and a **group** in this LDAP server?

* Specifically, if you look at an LDAP directory entry, how do you tell if it is a user or a group entry?

As an example, here is the entry for `julie`:

```bash
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org cn=julie \* \+
```

```bash
# julie, engineering.example.org
dn: cn=julie,dc=engineering,dc=example,dc=org
structuralObjectClass: inetOrgPerson
entryUUID: 3a204884-2507-1039-83ea-df23cd78e201
creatorsName: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
createTimestamp: 20190617045051Z
entryCSN: 20190617045051.770037Z#000000#000#000000
modifiersName: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
modifyTimestamp: 20190617045051Z
entryDN: cn=julie,dc=engineering,dc=example,dc=org
subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
hasSubordinates: FALSE
```


And this is the entry for `engineering_group`:

```bash
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org cn=engineering_group \* \+
```


```bash
# engineering_group, example.org
dn: cn=engineering_group,dc=example,dc=org
structuralObjectClass: posixGroup
entryUUID: 3a1a7ff8-2507-1039-83e4-df23cd78e201
creatorsName: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
createTimestamp: 20190617045051Z
entryCSN: 20190617045051.732134Z#000000#000#000000
modifiersName: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
modifyTimestamp: 20190617045051Z
entryDN: cn=engineering_group,dc=example,dc=org
subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
hasSubordinates: FALSE
```

Task:

* Identify the attributes that might indicate that `julie` is a person and `engineering_group` is a group

Hint: look at the differing values for `structuralObjectClass`


## Part 2: Configure server

In this part, you configure your server with `sssd`. 


### Task: Create sssd.conf file

`sssd` helps you integrate your Linux system with LDAP. The configuration template is in your workshop materials.

**Important: You can find the workshop materials at `/usr/share/class/`.**


Tasks:

* Copy the configuration template `s-template.txt` to `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`.


??? note "Show me how..."

    ```sh
    sudo cp /usr/share/class/s-template.txt /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
    ```


### Task: Edit the sssd.conf file

Task:

* Fill out the missing values in `sssd.conf` using the example output from the LDAP server in the previous task


These are the values you must complete:

```bash
ldap_user_object_class = posixAccount
ldap_user_name = cn
ldap_user_uuid = entryUUID
ldap_user_shell = loginShell
ldap_user_home_directory = homeDirectory
ldap_user_uid_number = uidNumber
```

And the meaning of these fields ([source](https://linux.die.net/man/5/sssd-ldap))

Configuration option     | The LDAP attribute that...
-----------------------  | ----------------------
ldap_user_object_class   | specifies the object class of a user entry in LDAP
ldap_user_name           | corresponds to the user's login name
ldap_user_uuid           | contains the UUID/GUID of an LDAP user object.
ldap_user_shell          | contains the path to the user's default shell.
ldap_user_home_directory | contains the name of the user's home directory
ldap_user_uid_number     | corresponds to the user's id


If you get stuck, you can find a full example configuration of `sssd.conf` in `s-answer.txt`.


### Task: Test sssd is working

Next, restart the `sssd` service:

```bash
sudo chown root:root /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
sudo chmod 600 /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
sudo systemctl restart sssd
sudo systemctl status sssd
```

To test that `sssd` is working correctly, try:

```bash
id julie
```

Make sure that the information matches with the ldap search for Julie:

```bash
ldapsearch -w admin -h leader.example.org -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org -b dc=example,dc=org cn=julie
```

Consider these questions:

* Did you get meaningful output?
* If you did, try a few more users from the LDAP system. Do these users exist on your system?
* Where is the information coming from?



### Signs of success: sssd configured 

You have successfully configured your server to recognize LDAP. PAM can now call the `sssd` service and find users in the LDAP directory.

The next step is to configure RStudio Server Pro with PAM.



## Part 3: Configure RSP

In this part, you configure RStudio Server Pro to connect to LDAP via PAM.


### Task: Set up PAM Profiles

RStudio Server Pro supports PAM sessions. The PAM sessions work with `sssd` to authenticate users.

Tasks

1. Copy the following files (**Remember:** workshop materials are under `/usr/share/class/`.):

    What        | From:                  | To:
    -------     | ---------------------- | ----------------------------
    PAM profile | `rstudio-sssd`         | `/etc/pam.d/rstudio`
    PAM profile | `rstudio-session-sssd` | `/etc/pam.d/rstudio-session`


2. Edit the `/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf` file. Add the following line:


```bash
auth-pam-sessions-profile=rstudio-session
```


Explanation

* PAM offers flexible control over system level authentication
* Specific PAM exploration is outside of the bounds of this course
* Open each file and explore the contents


### Task: Test authentication

You can use the `pamtester` utility to test the PAM profile for a specific user.  You cand find documentation for `pamtester` [here](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/authenticating-users.html#diagnosing-pam-authentication-problems)

In this classroom, the password for every user is the same as their user name.  For example:

* User: jen
* Password: jen

Task

* Use the `pamtester` utility to test authentication for `jen:jen`


```bash
sudo /usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/pamtester --verbose rstudio jen authenticate
```

* Enter the password.

You should get:

```bash
pamtester: successfully authenticated
```

### Task: Create user accounts


Every RStudio Server user must have a home directory.

From the [admin guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/authenticating-users.html):

> R users require local system accounts regardless of what RStudio authentication method you use. You should set up local system accounts manually and then map authenticating users to these accounts. You can also use PAM Sessions to mount your user home directory to the server.

* If a user does not have a home directory, they will get a `system error 13
(Permission Denied)` message in their browser when they try to log in

(It is possible to use the `rstudio-session` PAM profile to create home directories automatically when a user logs into the server, but that's outside the scope of this course.)


Tasks:

* Create a local system account for the user `jen`

```bash
sudo mkdir /home/jen
sudo chown jen: /home/jen
```
  
??? note "Why does this work?"
    The linux command `chown` changes the ownership of a file or folder.  The typical syntax is `chown username:groupname ...` and you have to specify the new `username` as well as the new `groupname`.
    However, there is special syntax for `chown` that allows you to omit either the `username` or the `groupname`.
    In this example, `chown jen:` omits the groupname, and then the behaviour of `chown` is to substitute the default groupname.

You can read more in the manual pages for linux, also known as the "man pages", by typing:

```sh
man chown
```



### Task: Restart RStudio Server

You must restart RStudio Server Pro for your configuration change to take effect

!!! note

    * Refer to the admin guide, section [2.1.2 Stopping and Starting](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/server-management.html#stopping-and-starting)

    * To manually stop, start, and restart the server you use the following commands:

    ```sh
    sudo rstudio-server stop
    sudo rstudio-server start
    ```

    or just:

    ```sh
    sudo rstudio-server restart
    ```


To check the current stopped/started status of the server:

```sh
sudo rstudio-server status
```

### Task: Log in as a user that exists in LDAP

Log into RStudio Server Pro in your browser using one of the users from the LDAP Server.

* Important: **Since RStudio Server Pro now authenticates only users in LDAP, you must log in as one of those users**
* Also, a user home folder must exist, so make sure you've created a home folder!
* practically speaking, this means you must log in as `jen`, since you created a home folder for `jen` in the previous step
    
    
![image](assets/login-as-jen.png)


!!! tip "Remember"
    In this classroom LDAP server, user passwords are the same as the username, i.e. `jen:jen`, `julie:julie`, `joe:joe`, etc.


## Taking stock

### Success ??

!!! success
    Once you have logged in successfully, you have completed this portion of the exercise!


### Failure ?!

!!! failure "Some things that could go wrong:"
    1. You get the warning message:
        ```
        WARNINGS: The auth-pam-sessions-enabled option requires the PAM profile 
        /etc/pam.d/rstudio-session however that profile does not exist. 
        Disabling support for PAM sessions.
        ```
        This probably means:
        * you forgot to copy the PAM Profile files in the task "Set up PAM profiles", OR 
        * you didn't edit the `/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf` file.
    2. You forgot the URL for your RStudio Server Pro session
        * Review the joining instructions sent via email and bookmark your Virtual Machine URL.
    3. You logged in as `admin-user`
        * Remember that you now use LDAP to authenticate, and `admin-user` is not an authenticated user in LDAP
        * Log in as a user that exists, and that has a home folder, e.g. `jen`


## Security best practices

!!! note "Closing thought:"

    * In this course we supplied a demonstration `sssd` config file (`s-answer.txt`), and in this example file encryption is specifically disabled.
    * Note that this is a test setup, without encryption enabled.  This is not suggested for anything but testing, as your credentials will pass over the wire in plain text!
    * In your own environment, you should get a security expert to review your configuration.
