## Success

How do you know it worked?

```sh
sudo tail /var/log/rstudio-connect.log
```

You should see something like this:

```sh
2019/01/10 22:25:07 Using HTTP access log: /var/log/rstudio-connect.access.log
2019/01/10 22:25:07 Sweeping ad-hoc variants
2019/01/10 22:25:07 Starting HTTP listener on :3939
```

The last line means Connect is listening on port 3939.


You can also open the connect landing page (from your course login page).
