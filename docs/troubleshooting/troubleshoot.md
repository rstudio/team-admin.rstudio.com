In this session you learn:

* about common pitfalls
* about tools for identifying the root cause
* other tips and techniques to stay on the happy path


## Introduction

### General troubleshooting tips

Identify what the error is and where it's coming from

* An error reported in the IDE might arise from:
    - User code, an R package, or R itself
    - The RStudio IDE

* How widespread is this issue?
    - Does it affect one user, the entire server, or the whole cluster?

* Can you reproduce the problem?

* Identify the root cause of the error
    - Any recent changes?
    - Specific users or groups involved?
    - Specific code being run? 

!!! tip
    Change **one thing at a time** to try and isolate the issue



### Things RStudio Support looks at (and you should too):  

* Log files
* R   
* Local environment and environment variables 

Common issues:

* Licensing  
* Configuration
* Authentication  
* Network issues  



## Log file locations

1. RStudio log files


    Product               | Log file
    --------------------  | ------------------
    RStudio Workbench    | `/var/lib/rstudio-server/monitor/log/rstudio-server.log`
    Shiny Server Pro      | `/var/log/shiny-server.log`
    RStudio Connect       | `/var/log/rstudio-connect.log`
    Package Manager       | `/var/log/rstudio-pm.log`



2. System log files

    Area                 | Log file
    -------------------  | ----------------------------------------------------
    Server log files     | `/var/log/syslog` <br/> OR <br/> `/var/log/messages`
    Authentication logs  | `/var/log/auth.log` <br/> OR <br/> `/var/log/secure`



3. For RStudio Connect deployment issues:

    You can view the generated deployment log in the R console, or retrieve from R using the `rsconnect` package:

    ```R
    library(rsconnect)
    rsconnect::showLogs()
    ```

## Troubleshooting R

### R runs correctly

* Almost all RStudio products depend on R being installed successfully to run.
    - Look for errors related to R in the server logs
* Can R be launched manually and can the user's code be run in R without any errors?
* How was R installed? 
    - From source or [pre-compiled binaries](https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-r/)? If so, were all correct flags and capabilities set?  

```sh
grep configure R_HOME/etc/Makeconf
```

![image](assets/grep_makeconf.png)
        


Are all necessary dependencies installed? 

```sh
apt-get build-dep r-base
yum-builddep R
```

Are the permissions set correctly to allow `r-x` (read and execute) by all?      

```sh
namei -l /path/to/R
```

### Multiple versions of R

      
Are there multiple versions of R on the system?

```sh
apt-get install mlocate
updatedb
locate libR.so
```

```
## locate libR.so
/opt/R/3.4.4/lib/R/lib/libR.so
/opt/R/3.5.1/lib/R/lib/libR.so
```



If so, see questions above for all versions in addition to checking that the expected version is loaded.



## Troubleshooting the environment

### Local environment 

What operating system are you running on?

```sh
uname -a

cat /etc/*-release
```

Are you running with load balancing or in a virtual container such as Docker, etc?



### Environment variables

Does your setup rely on specific environment variables to be set correctly?

If so, are those set correctly in R as well as RStudio? 

* Proxy settings
* Java
* Database connections
* System library path issues
    - For example, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH`, etc.
    
R pulls from several startup files

* Refer to the R Views blog article ["Understanding Râ€™s Startup"](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/04/19/r-for-enterprise-understanding-r-s-startup/)




### Configuration

Look for any errors in the startup.  

* You can view the live log during startup using
  
```sh
tail -f /path/to/log
```

Read through the admin guides and make sure you have the correct formatting

Make sure you're on the right version of the product compared to the admin guide!

## Expired licenses

* Things to try:

    - Check time and time zone  `timedatectl`
    - Resync if needed, e.g. `sudo hwclock -w`
    - Restart

* Deactivation tool: http://apps.rstudio.com/deactivate-license/

* Long-term solutions
    - Consider switching to offline setup

* RStudio is working on improvements




## Authentication


* Difficult for RStudio Support to troubleshoot as it depends on external configuration values unknown to us.

* Does it work outside of the RStudio product?

    * Often possible to copy over working setup from other systems or services.
    * For RStudio Workbench
    * `pamtester` utility lets you test outside RStudio systems.
  
```sh
sudo /usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/pamtester \
  --verbose rstudio <username> authenticate
```
  
* Check server log files including `access.log` files.
* Check connections to any external authentication providers
    - Kerberos, Active Directory, etc.



## Network issues


Network issues are outsidet the scope of the [RStudio support SLA](https://rstudio.com/about/support-agreement/).

This means we're limited on the help we can provide.

Things to check:

* Connectivity
* SSL / certificate
* Firewall / security / proxy settings
